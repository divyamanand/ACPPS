# Automated Greenhouse System

## 1. System Overview

The automated greenhouse system aims to create an optimal environment for plant growth by monitoring and controlling various environmental factors. The system uses a network of sensors, actuators, and a central control unit to maintain ideal conditions for plants.

## 2. Key Components

### 2.1 Sensors
- Temperature sensors
- Humidity sensors
- Light sensors (PAR - Photosynthetically Active Radiation)
- Soil moisture sensors
- CO2 sensors
- pH sensors for hydroponic systems

### 2.2 Actuators
- HVAC system for temperature control
- Humidifiers/Dehumidifiers
- LED grow lights
- Automated irrigation system
- Nutrient delivery system for hydroponics
- Ventilation fans
- Motorized shade cloths or curtains

### 2.3 Control System
- Microcontroller or Single Board Computer (e.g., Raspberry Pi)
- Wi-Fi module for connectivity
- Power management system
- Data storage (local and/or cloud-based)

### 2.4 User Interface
- Mobile app for remote monitoring and control
- Web-based dashboard
- Local touch screen display (optional)

## 3. System Functionality

### 3.1 Environmental Monitoring
- Continuous monitoring of temperature, humidity, light levels, soil moisture, CO2, and pH
- Data logging and trend analysis

### 3.2 Automated Control
- Temperature regulation using HVAC system
- Humidity control via humidifiers/dehumidifiers and ventilation

- Irrigation based on soil moisture levels and plant needs
- Nutrient delivery for hydroponic systems
- CO2 level management for optimal photosynthesis

### 3.3 Intelligent Scheduling
- Implementing day/night cycles for lighting
- Seasonal adjustments for temperature and humidity
- Growth stage-specific environmental control

### 3.4 Data Analysis and Reporting
- Generate reports on environmental conditions and plant growth
- Predictive analysis for crop yields
- Resource usage tracking (water, energy, nutrients)

### 3.5 Remote Monitoring and Control
- Real-time monitoring via mobile app or web dashboard
- Remote adjustment of environmental parameters
- Alert system for abnormal conditions or system malfunctions

## 4. Potential Enhancements
